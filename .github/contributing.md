# Contributing Guidelines

:back: [README.md](./README.md)

Contributions welcome!

**Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!**

Please search issues and pull requests before adding something new to avoid duplicating
efforts and conversations.

This project welcomes non-code contributions, too! The following types of contributions
are welcome:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
- **Writing**: contribute your expertise in an area by helping expand the included docs.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and improve the quality of the docs.
- **Formatting**: help keep docs easy to read with consistent formatting.

## Coding Style
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* 80 character line length

## Project Governance

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the
project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a
happiness guarded open source project.

### Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
2. **Non-master branches** should be used for ongoing work.
3. **Significant modifications** like API changes should be subject to a **pull request**
  to solicit feedback from other contributors.
4. **Pull requests** are *encouraged* for all contributions to solicit feedback, but left to
  the discretion of the contributor.
5. Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
    ```
    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
    ```

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/dotiful/netlify-express-api/issues/new/choose) it's that easy!

## Pull Request Process

  1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
    build.
  2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
    variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
  3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
    Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
  4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
    do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
